## Overview and Origin
Trendspider is a Niche Theory Holdings Company.  Niche Theory Holdings LLC was formed on March 16, 2018 while Trendspider LLC was formed on March 9, 2018 and Trendspider Applied Technical Analysis LLC was formed on December 26, 2018.  The company was founded by Dan Ushman and Ruslan Lagutin. The idea for the company was formed in 2016 when Dan and Ruslan were tired of the inefficiences and sub-par results of manual charting.  Their goals was to build a charting platform that would help reduce "profit-killing" mistakes by making chart analysis more consistent. Trendspider is a private company so funding data is not availalbe.  From what I can find it is self-funded by Dan Ushman after his previous start-up SingleHop was acquired in 2018 for $132 million in cash.

## Business Activities
Trendspider is trying to improve traders' technical analysis of stock charts to improve profitability.  Their goal is to reduce/remove inconsistent chart analysis, inherent bias, subjectiveness of regular technical traders to gain some edge back against trading firms, hedge funds, and algorithmic traders.  Their intend customer are both new and seasoned retail traders. 

In 2015, CME Group reported that there were 16 million active, experienced traders with a retail brokerage account taking 10 or more trades per month. Although data was not found for more recent years it can be assumed that the number of active retail traders is much higher due to commission-free brokerage accounts and easy of access to data from a mobile device.  Based on research by Chappuis Halder, in June of 2019 they estimate between 51.2 and 52.4 million active crypto traders.  The data for active forex traders is much wider with estimate ranging from 10 to 77 million active traders. 

They differentiate themselves from competitors because they are an AI-powered technical analysis platform.  They offer the following features:

	* Automatic trendline detection and Fibonoacci levels
	* Candlestick patten recognition with ability set an alert
	* S/R heatmap visualization
	* Multiple timeframe analysis for indicators, trendlines and Fibonacci levels
	* Dynamic price alerts based on indicators, trendlines and Fibonacci levels
	* Real-time and automated, in-line backtesting
	* Rain Drop Charts

Trendspider is currenctly using the following technologies:

	* Node.js
	* ES6
	* Angualar
	* Docker
	* C++ and C#
	* Java
	* Barchart data APIs


## Landscape

Trendspider is falls within the investment management domain focused on chart analysis and trading. The major trend in the retail trading space has been the move by brokerages to offer commission-free trades and more abilities to trade while mobile. In the chart analysis space there really has not been that much innovation over the past 5 to 10 years.  It has been the different companies providing market data with the same indicators served up in a differnet package.

Trendspider's major competitors at this time is Finviz, Trading View, Trade Ideas, Yahoo Finance, and ProphetCharts.  With the future goals of the company they will compete against companies like eSignal, Sierra Charts, and other charting platforms that allow users to connect their brokerage accounts to the software.

## Results

The company is relatively new in the space so there is not much data on it's impact to the industry.  The companies in this domain track the number of new users per month, cancellation vs renewal rates, and usage metrics such as number of alerts, scans, or backtested done in the platform. In 2019 there was over 40,000 alerts and 35,000 backtest completed on the platform.  In March of 2020 Trendspider broke 1000 new users in one month and as of mid-April they have 4000+ users of their platform.  As mentioned, Trendspider is a new company in this space so they are much smaller than their competitors.  With that said, they are gaining traction with new users per month, onboarding certified partner, and increased followers on social media.   

## Recommendations

If I were advising the company I would recommend to:

	1. Real-time data for all markets
	2. Integrate with brokerage/trading accounts
	3. Custom scripting for indicators with a marketplace
	4. Automated trading for backtested strategies
	5. Algorithm trading strategy marketplace

The addition of these functionalities would make them a all-in-one platform which would lead to increasing the amount of users.  The introduction of a marketplace for custom built indicators and algorithm trading strategies would give their experience traders a way to potential add another stream of income.  This would be done by charging users a fee for downloading/using a custom build indicator or a percentage of profits if a user selects to have a custom algo trade their account similar to Collective 2. 

The techologies the new products could utilize are FPGA or Hadoop.  These two options would provide them access to a suite of solution, applications, libaries, and other technologies that will help is speeding up data process, reducing network latency, and provide machine learning cababilities.  Examples of available technologies from FPGA and Hadoop are Algo-Logic, Apache Spark, MLib, MySql, Xlinx Alevo, Mahout, Submarine, and Zookeeper.  These techologies are widely used in the industry which would make it easier to find qualified candidates to build and support the new products as the company grows.
